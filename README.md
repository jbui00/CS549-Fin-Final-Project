The goal of this program is to build classification models for predicting whether a company will be acquired based on its historical financial data. Different types of models need to be evaluated. 
# Non sequential models (nonseq.py)
For the non sequential model, we are using logisitic regression


# Sequential models (seq.py)
The sequential model we are using is LSTM.
